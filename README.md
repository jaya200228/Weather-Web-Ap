Weather Web App



Build a weather app that fetches and displays weather for a given location.
In this project you are required to build a weather app that displays the current weather details based on the location entered by the user. We will be leveraging a common weather API to achieve this.

You can use the Visual Crossing Weather API to fetch the weather data.
